        <p class="dcontent">The <span>&lt;input&gt;</span> HTML element is used to create interactive controls 
            for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of 
            input data and control widgets are available, depending on the device and user agent.
             The <span>&lt;input&gt;</span> element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due 
             to the sheer number of combinations of input types and attributes.</p>
